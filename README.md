# smashggwebscrape
A program that scrapes a profile's Super Smash Bros results from their smashgg account.

Requirements to Run
pandas, seaborn, BeautifulSoup, their depedancies, and an internet connection

Summary
My goal was to take information from my smashgg account to create a graphical representation of my competitive gaming career. I built a webscraper that goes through a smashgg account's results pages and scrapes what it finds. The account defaults to mine but it will work with any account, so long as you change the variable in the program to that which appears behind the name of the account on the account's smashgg profile page. My program continutes to collect results pages until it comes across an empty page. The resulting pages are mined for specific important fields, and the information is transformed and presented in 6 different graphs. The first is a comparison of a player's results in online versus offline tournaments. The information I needed seemed to be represented as a json file, but because it was nearly impossible for me to determine where the file ended (and it had a lot of junk data) I instead parsed larger strings for keywords that were specific fields I needed.

The results are graphed in chronological order, showing the percentage of competition they outplaced. I chose this statistic over placement because winning a 13 person event is not as impressive as second at one with 130. While this representation isn't perfect, it gives a rough approximation of results over time. The next graph is events entered and is quite straightforward, being represented as a bar chart. One struggle I had with this is some tournament organizers give their events quite unorthodox names, and I would have to write a complicated regex to sort out some that weren\t immediately identifiable as the kind of events I was mainly looking for. In addition, some players might play other games entirely, and these results shouldn't be counted. Instead, I created an 'Other' event these events fell under. Next graph is events by state. I didn't include online events because the point of the graph was to demonstrate how much a player has traveled. The fourth graph is placement with respect to proportion. This shows how well a player is at keeping up with larger events. For amateurs like me, this graph isn't very exciting because I don't have many large events, and zero I did significantly well at, but it is more informing for better players. I didn't want to exclude any events, so the scale is less than desireable for looking only at smaller scale events. Maybe in the future I will add another graph that is a zoomed in version of this one. Next is an attempt to break down tournaments into several different class based on attendees, with Supermajor being 500+ attendees while Smashfests are under 12. Placments for each kind of event is graphed over time. Again, the scale of larger events makes it more difficult to absorb the information being conveyed, but if you look closely you can see my performance at "locals" has improved steadily. Lastly, I have a graph representing players' most common teammates for doubles.
